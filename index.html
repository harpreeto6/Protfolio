        <h1>Welcome to My Professional Portfolio!</h1>

        <p>
            Hi, I’m Harpreet Singh – a software developer and an Honours Mathematics student at the University of British Columbia. I enjoy solving problems and finding innovative ways to use technology in everyday life.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve worked with several programming languages and tools, including Java, Python, C++, and C#, and I have experience using frameworks like Unreal Engine. I’m always looking for new ways to improve my skills and build useful software.
        </p>

        <p>
            Along with coding, I enjoy diving into data analysis and AI. I’ve had the opportunity to work on projects that involve everything from building simple apps to creating AI models.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m currently seeking new opportunities where I can continue learning and contribute to projects that have a real impact.
        </p>
